# preCICE-adapter for the CSM code Code_Aster

This adapter was implemented as part of the [master thesis of Lucia Cheung](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Cheung2016_Thesis.pdf) in cooperation with [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/). Currently only conjugate heat transfer is supported.

The adapter currently supports preCICE v2.2.0 and Code_Aster v14.4. The following tutorials are available.

* Flow over plate OpenFoam-Code_Aster ([wiki](https://github.com/precice/code_aster-adapter/wiki/Flow-over-plate-Code_Aster-Tutorial))

A documentation is available in the `cht` subfolder, and in the [wiki](https://github.com/precice/code_aster-adapter/wiki).
